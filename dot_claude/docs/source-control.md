## Source Control

- Let's try and use JJ as much as we can. If JJ isn't configured, or not available then use git.
- Commit messages should be concise and descriptive.
- Commit messages should follow the conventional commit format.
- Commit messages should be written in the imperative mood.
- Commit messages should be written in the present tense.

### Atomic Commits

- ALWAYS prefer small, atomic commits that do a single thing.
- Each commit should represent one logical change (one feature, one fix, one refactor).
- If you have multiple unrelated changes, split them into separate commits.
- This makes history easier to read, review, bisect, and revert if needed.
